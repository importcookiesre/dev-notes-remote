## Components

The Prometheus ecosystem consists of multiple components, many of which are optional:

- the main [Prometheus server](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) which scrapes and stores time series data
- [client libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) for instrumenting application code
- a [push gateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) for supporting short-lived jobs
- special-purpose [exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) for services like HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc.
- an [alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) to handle alerts
- various support tools
